# "The relationship between intelligence and reaction time varies with age: Results from three representative narrow-age age cohorts at 30, 50 and 69 years"

Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289617300636?via%3Dihub

Contents: 4-choice complex reaction time > simple reaction time for correlation with intelligence. This correlation _increases_ with age. For people in their ~70s, there's a correlation of ~0.53 with results on AH4; for people in their ~30s, it's ~0.44. (For simple reaction time, the correlation is ~0.27 for people in their ~30s and ~0.32 for people in their ~70s.) Note that combining age cohorts exagerates the correlation, because of how reaction time goes up and AH4 goes down with age. They also speculate studies have underestimated the correlation between intelligence and reaction time because of drawing on student populations.

There are some good scatterplots in the article. Note that the 4-choice tasks is simply hitting the labeled button when 0, 1, 2, or 4 shows.

# "Intelligence and speed of information-processing: A review of 50 years of research"

Contents: "With these restrictions in place, 172 articles were included in the actual review and analyses."

"Finally, multivariate behavioral genetics have reported moderate to very strong genetic correlations between measures of mental speed and IQ."

Types of speed tasks:

- Reaction time -- how fast can you press 1, 2, 4 buttons in response to a stimulus?
- "general speed of information-processing" -- "how quickly participants can perform simple mental arithmetic or can connect numbers or letters scattered on a page in ascending order"
- Speed of short-term memory processing tasks -- Sternberg, was an element shown previously
- Speed of long-term memory retrieval tasks -- "measures of the difference between reaction times when deciding whether stimuli are semantically versus physically identical, and tasks in which subjects indicate whether pairs of words are synonyms or antonyms or belong to the same or different categories."

For reaction time, correlations with g have been found in the 0.2 to 0.4 range, _increasing_ with the number of bits of information to process. So it finds a mean correlation of something like 0.22 for 1-bit tasks, and 0.38 for 4-bit tasks.

"The results also reveal that mental speed often (though not always) correlates more strongly with gf than with gc."

"The overall correlation between mental speed and intelligence is moderate but very consistent: across all the different studies and measures that were reviewed – which yielded a total of 1146 correlations – the mean correlation is −.24 (s = .07)."
