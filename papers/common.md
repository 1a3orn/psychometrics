# Link: https://gwern.net/doc/iq/2007-tenijenhuis.pdf

# TLDR: More-g loaded tests are harder to improve with coaching.

# Excerpts:

"Neubauer and Freudenthaler (1994) showed that after 9 h of practice the g loading of a modestly complex intelligence test dropped from .46 to .39."

"In the first study, Jensen (1998a, ch. 10) analyzed the effectof practice on the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB). He found negative correlations ranging from −.11 to −.86 between effect sizes on practice and the tests' g loadings."

AlphaSpan, N-Back, doesn't increase intelligence. Makse nice point that you should need to expect > 30 hours to see any effect.
