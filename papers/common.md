#Title: Score gains on g-loaded tests: No g

# Link: https://gwern.net/doc/iq/2007-tenijenhuis.pdf

# TLDR: More-g loaded tests are harder to improve with coaching.

# Excerpts:

"Neubauer and Freudenthaler (1994) showed that after 9 h of practice the g loading of a modestly complex intelligence test dropped from .46 to .39."

"In the first study, Jensen (1998a, ch. 10) analyzed the effectof practice on the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB). He found negative correlations ranging from −.11 to −.86 between effect sizes on practice and the tests' g loadings."

AlphaSpan, N-Back, doesn't increase intelligence. Makse nice point that you should need to expect > 30 hours to see any effect.

TLDR: Claims positive transfer.

"In each practice session, participants practiced 12 different tasks. For PS, these were three two-choice reaction tasks (odd vs. even numbers; consonants vs. vowels; symmetric vs. asymmetric figures) and three comparison tasks (two strings of digits; two strings of consonants; two three-dimensional figures). For EM, participants had to memorize word lists, number-word pairs, or object positions in a grid. WM tasks were adapted versions of the alpha span (Craik, 1986), numerical memory updating (Salthouse et al., 1991), and spatial n-back (Cohen et al., 1997) tasks."
